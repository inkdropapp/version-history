## Design updates for Windows and Linux!

The default white title bar on Windows messes up the app clean design, especially with dark themes.
In this release, you've got the new custom title bar with a frameless window. Please take a look at this:

By getting rid of the white strip bar, we can now have the acrylic translucent background on Windows, which looks stunning:
