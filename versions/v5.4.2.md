## Bugfixes

* Incorrect IME composition window (Thanks [Otawara](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/ime/2582))
* The editor scrollbar `z-index` is higher than the editor drawer (Thanks [Otawara](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/topic/2588))

## Improvement

* Update notification has been moved from a separate window to the bottom of the sidebar in order not to be distractive
