You've got big updates that would significantly improve your workflow ðŸ’ª

### Local REST API endpoint
It allows other programs to access your data in your computer via a simple HTTP API. Why is it awesome? See below..

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/accessing-the-local-database/#accessing-via-http-advanced)

### Alfred integration for searching notes quickly
![Alfref integration](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-integrating-with-alfred_screenshot.png?raw=true)

With the local REST API endpoint enabled, it gives a lot of possibilities to integrate Inkdrop with the existing productivity tools like Alfred!
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is the powerful alternative to Spotlight on macOS. By integrating Inkdrop and Alfred, you can instantly search your notes from Alfred.

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/integrating-with-alfred)

### Browser integrations for clipping web pages in Markdown

Another benefit of having the local REST endpoint is the web clipper.
It lets you save any web page off the internet to your Inkdrop database in Markdown so you can read or edit it later, while synchronizing it securely via the end-to-end encryption.
The browser extensions are available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox!

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/clipping-web-pages-from-browser)

### Better note conflict resolution
![Conflicted note](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-conflict-resolver.png?raw=true)

Inkdrop sometimes automatically resolves note conflicts but it could cause unwanted results in some cases.
In this update, it provides a dedicated UI for resolving the note conflicts.
You can view conflicted revisions in a separate window respectively to manually resolve the conflicts, which would prevent losing your edits.
It will be also supported in the mobile version.

### Other New features
* Show editing note title in title bar
