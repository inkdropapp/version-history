## Revision history view just got better

Inkdrop keeps a history of changes made in your notes locally. Whenever you save the current version, Inkdrop automatically creates a new 'revision'. This is useful when you want to restore a previous revision.

In earlier versions, you had to select a revision from a dropdown list like this:

It was annoying to select revisions one by one to find the exact revision you want.

In v5.10.0, it has got a timeline-like UI for the revision history, which lets you quickly view your note changelogs:

It displays not only the note body but also changes like notebook moves, tag additions/removals, note status updates, and title changes. Even if you're not restoring an old revision, it's fun to explore your note history!

Click the three-dot button on the right side of each revision to open a popup menu with options:

- Open in separate window
- Restore this revision

Enjoy viewing your tech note chronicle!

The note tags input bar now smoothly animates when adding or removing tags, making the experience slightly more satisfying :)
