    ## Design updates for Windows and Linux!

    The default white title bar on Windows messes up the app clean design, especially with dark themes.
    In this release, you've got the new custom title bar with a frameless window. Please take a look at this:

    ![Custom title bar on Windows](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.4.0-default-dark.png?raw=true)

    By getting rid of the white strip bar, we can now have the acrylic translucent background on Windows, which looks stunning:

    ![Vibrant dark UI demo](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.4.0-vibrant-dark.png?raw=true)

    Try installing [vibrant-dark-ui theme](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/vibrant-dark-ui).

    ## New feature
    
    * Tab size option (Thanks [Avis](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/processing-pasted-tabs/2521))

    ## Improvement

    * Code-sign the Windows installer

    ## A bunch of bugfixes

    * Scroll past end should stop at the last line (Thanks [Nicole](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/scrolling-past-the-end-of-a-note/2538))
    * The app crashes on quitting on Windows 8 (Thanks [Dmitriy](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/inkdrop-crashes-on-quit-on-windows-8-1/2543))
    * Empty task list should have a height (Thanks [Magnus](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/checkboxes-collide-with-following-line-in-preview/2541))

    You've got big updates that would significantly improve your workflow 💪

    ### Local REST API endpoint
    It allows other programs to access your data in your computer via a simple HTTP API. Why is it awesome? See below..

    * [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/accessing-the-local-database/#accessing-via-http-advanced)

    ### Alfred integration for searching notes quickly
    ![Alfref integration](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-integrating-with-alfred_screenshot.png?raw=true)

    With the local REST API endpoint enabled, it gives a lot of possibilities to integrate Inkdrop with the existing productivity tools like Alfred!
    [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is the powerful alternative to Spotlight on macOS. By integrating Inkdrop and Alfred, you can instantly search your notes from Alfred.

    * [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/integrating-with-alfred)

    ### Browser integrations for clipping web pages in Markdown
    ![Web clipper](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-web-clipper.png?raw=true)

    Another benefit of having the local REST endpoint is the web clipper.
    It lets you save any web page off the internet to your Inkdrop database in Markdown so you can read or edit it later, while synchronizing it securely via the end-to-end encryption.
    The browser extensions are available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox!

    * [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/clipping-web-pages-from-browser)

    ### Better note conflict resolution
    ![Conflicted note](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-conflict-resolver.png?raw=true)

    Inkdrop sometimes automatically resolves note conflicts but it could cause unwanted results in some cases.
    In this update, it provides a dedicated UI for resolving the note conflicts.
    You can view conflicted revisions in a separate window respectively to manually resolve the conflicts, which would prevent losing your edits.
    It will be also supported in the mobile version.

    ### Other New features
    * Show editing note title in title bar
      ![Title bar](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0_title.png?raw=true)
    * Dock menu for opening new window (Thanks [Yusuke](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/macos-dock-inkdrop/2328))  
      ![Dock menu](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0_dock-menu.png?raw=true)

    ### Improvements
    * Show "Offline" when unreachable to the Inkdrop server (Thanks [zed](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/silent-sync-failure-behind-corporate-proxy-data-loss-scenario/2206) and [Jon](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/https-key-pinning-issues-causes-silent-sync-failure/2417))
      ![Offline status](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-offline.png?raw=true)
    * Upgrade Electron from 7 to 12
    * API: add `editor-floating-actions` layout that allows you to add custom floating action buttons on the editor ([See the doc](https://beta.docs.inkdrop.app/reference/state-layouts#editor-floating-actions)) (Thanks Ron)
    * Scroll sidebar to the selection automatically when opened a notebook (Thanks [Shogo](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/open-notebook/2365))
    * Network diagnosis to help configure Inkdrop for running it behind corporate proxy from menu *Help -> Run Network Diagnosis*.
    * Set window background to dark on dark mode to avoid flashy white backgrounds (Thanks [Hugh](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/incomplete-darkmode-white-background-when-opening-new-windows/2371))
    * View an old revision in a separate window
    * Support Elixir language (Thanks Clish54)
    * Better HTML -> Markdown converter. It can now detect languages in code blocks in HTML.

    ### Bugfixes
    * Prevent adding more than one tags with the same name (Thanks [Avis](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/multiple-identical-tags/2314/2))
    * Change folder structure and file name of backup files that avoid using `:` character, which is prohibited in some cloud storage services (Thanks [Ryan, Nicole, and Evan](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/is-not-supported-in-onedrive-amazon-drive-or-sync-com/2265))

    g'day. Automn is coming! 🍁

    ### Faster restoration of navigation state
    Quicker to resume your work!

    ### Add 'Insert image' toolbar button
    I don't remember why I didn't add it before, haha.  
    ![Open link context menu](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.1.1_insert-image.png?raw=true)

    ### Good news for vimmers: 'Open Link' context menu for URL tokens in the editor
    When you use it with vim plugin, double-clicking to open a link does not work as the event is handled by the plugin.
    Allowing to open a link from the context menu would solve such issue.
    Also we got 'Copy Link Address' menu as well.  
    ![Open link context menu](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.1.1_open-link-context-menu.png?raw=true)

    ### Bugfixes

    * Search query not cleared when restoring 'all notes' navigation state

    ### It remembers your work state! 🤯
    Now it supports restoring the last navigation state on launching.
    It means that Inkdrop remembers which note you were editing, and sidebar and note list state, including search keywords.
    So, you can quickly resume your work even if you fell asleep in the middle of work :)

    ### Better note exportability
    When you wrote up a note, it should be able to be exported quickly. This update improves the note exportability so that you can work with other apps faster.

    * Support "Copy as HTML" and "Copy as Simple HTML" context menu to note list (Thanks [Joey](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/can-you-add-copy-as-html-function/2083))  
      <img src="https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.1.0_copy-as-html.png?raw=true" style="width: 300px" />
    * Support exporting a notebook as Markdown or HTML from sidebar context menu  
      <img src="https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.1.0_export-notebook.png?raw=true" style="width: 300px" />
    * Support exporting multiple selected notes as Markdown (Thanks [Marco](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/export-selected-notes-as-markdown/253/5?u=craftzdog))
    * Support batch export as pdf format
    * Support copying note with images as HTML from preview pane (Thanks [Mike](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/copy-image-from-inkdrop-paste-into-another-app/1845))  
      VIDEO🎬: [devlog: Fixing a bug of my Electron-based React app!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jizO0wnKjIg)

    ### Other improvements
    * Set status and tag based on current query context (Thanks [Shogo-san](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/topic/2060))
      * When you are selecting a tag or status, new note will have the tag/status automatically.

    * source-map-support not working, causing 'Failed to render Markdown' error (Thanks [Jonathan, Brad, and Dav](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/failed-to-render-markdown-after-import-from-markdown/2039))
    * Some editor config values are not applied when changed (Thanks [Tahara-san](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/topic/2036))
    * 'core:navigate-back'/'core:navigate-forward' commands should be bound with <kbd>alt-left</kbd>/<kbd>alt-right</kbd> for the convention of Windows and Linux (Thanks [Otawara-san](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/windows-navigate-forward-navigate-back-os/2031))
