# Inkdrop Release Notes

## v5.6.0
2023-10-23

## üí® Faster launch speed

Managed to make it 500-700ms faster üöÄ

Here is a demo:

![file_Gs-9UL_8u|433x500](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0c3f975cfc231e951ba923fc4d86c959cd116295.gif)

**‚úçÔ∏è STORY**: [How I made Inkdrop 500ms faster to launchüöÄ](https://www.devas.life/how-i-made-inkdrop-500ms-faster-to-launch/)

### Loading plugins lazily

Along with v5.6.0, some plugins have been updated with performance improvements as well. [mermaid](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/mermaid) and [math](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/math) load their modules only when you open a note that uses one of them. It would keep the launch speed fast even if you installed plugins that require massive modules like them.

## üé® Markdown renderer engine update

v5.6.0 has upgraded Remark and Rehype packages to the latest versions. It isn't only an internal improvement but also gives you more possibilities to get useful features. It now has `mdast` and `hast` data in [the preview state](https://developers.inkdrop.app/states/preview), which allows to add syntax-aware features like outline views more easily without relying on regular expressions.

**‚úçÔ∏è STORY**: [Refactoring the extensible Markdown renderer üõ†Ô∏è](https://www.devas.life/refactoring-the-extensible-markdown-renderer/)

On the other hand, it may cause some plugins not working due to the breaking changes. For plugin developers, I'll post another topic to help you update your plugins.

## üåà Built-in paste-as-markdown support

Plugins are useful but it'd be a burden to explore and decide which plugins to install for light users. I wanted to make the app just work out of the box. As a starter, `paste-as-markdown` is now bundled into the app by default. It allows you to paste HTML as Markdown from the clipboard. It'd be useful for copy-and-pasting formatted texts from browsers.

I'm planning to bundle **Mermaid**, **GitHub Emoji**, and **Math** plugins as well.

## üòµ Acrylic window style is not working on Windows

* https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/lag-when-resizing-the-window-with-acrylic-background/4011

On Electron@25.1.1, the module that the app used to support the acrylic window style no longer works, unfortunately. The good news is that Electron itself officially supports the acrylic style for Windows:

* [feat: support Mica/Acrylic on Windows by codebytere ¬∑ Pull Request #38163 ¬∑ electron/electron ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38163)

The bad news is that it is not stable and working as expected ‚Äì It doesn't work with frameless windows, besides, it becomes unresizable and loses shadows. So, unfortunately, the acrylic window style is not supported on Windows in this release.

## ‚ú® Nested workspace views
In previous versions, pressing the "Detail" button on the notebook would take you to the workspace view, but you couldn't press the "Detail" button again once you were in that view.
In this update, the "Detail" button is now functional within the workspace view as well!

![nested workspace view](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70deb1d54021785330b8ff881f949ac253e9c37a.jpeg)

The sidebar now displays the path of the current and parent notebooks:

![nested workspace view 2](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4d01ce272032530449d11aa068cd52c488f928b.jpeg)

## Quick notebook picker for moving notes

You can more quickly choose a notebook :D

![notebook picker improved](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cb7323cd2469b5edaa8ce1e859a9f699ee6be4f2.jpeg)


## ‚ú® New API documentation (WIP)

![Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 15.01.06|690x439](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/17f34dadcd6918de386222e143eeb1fea9adea5c_2_1380x878.jpeg)


I've been working on redesigning the documentation and the new API documentation is now available as WIP.

https://developers.inkdrop.app/

The design is heavily inspired by Stripe, built on top of Tailwind UI. It supports full-text search now. There are still many missing pages and broken links though, your help to improve the doc would be greatly appreciated. It will be more comprehensive and easy to understand and I hope you like it :D

I'll be working on creating a new user manual as well!

2021-09-02

## Design updates for Windows and Linux!

The default white title bar on Windows messes up the app clean design, especially with dark themes.
In this release, you've got the new custom title bar with a frameless window. Please take a look at this:

![Custom title bar on Windows](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.4.0-default-dark.png?raw=true)

By getting rid of the white strip bar, we can now have the acrylic translucent background on Windows, which looks stunning:

![Vibrant dark UI demo](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.4.0-vibrant-dark.png?raw=true)

Try installing [vibrant-dark-ui theme](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/vibrant-dark-ui).

## v5.3.1

## v5.3.0
2021-05-03

You've got big updates that would significantly improve your workflow üí™

### Local REST API endpoint
It allows other programs to access your data in your computer via a simple HTTP API. Why is it awesome? See below..

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/accessing-the-local-database/#accessing-via-http-advanced)

### Alfred integration for searching notes quickly
![Alfref integration](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-integrating-with-alfred_screenshot.png?raw=true)

With the local REST API endpoint enabled, it gives a lot of possibilities to integrate Inkdrop with the existing productivity tools like Alfred!
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is the powerful alternative to Spotlight on macOS. By integrating Inkdrop and Alfred, you can instantly search your notes from Alfred.

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/integrating-with-alfred)

### Browser integrations for clipping web pages in Markdown
![Web clipper](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-web-clipper.png?raw=true)

Another benefit of having the local REST endpoint is the web clipper.
It lets you save any web page off the internet to your Inkdrop database in Markdown so you can read or edit it later, while synchronizing it securely via the end-to-end encryption.
The browser extensions are available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox!

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/clipping-web-pages-from-browser)

### Better note conflict resolution
![Conflicted note](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-conflict-resolver.png?raw=true)

Inkdrop sometimes automatically resolves note conflicts but it could cause unwanted results in some cases.
In this update, it provides a dedicated UI for resolving the note conflicts.
You can view conflicted revisions in a separate window respectively to manually resolve the conflicts, which would prevent losing your edits.
It will be also supported in the mobile version.

### Other New features
* Show editing note title in title bar
  ![Title bar](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0_title.png?raw=true)
* Dock menu for opening new window (Thanks [Yusuke](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/macos-dock-inkdrop/2328))  
  ![Dock menu](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0_dock-menu.png?raw=true)

* View an old revision in a separate window

* Better HTML -> Markdown converter. It can now detect languages in code blocks in HTML.

### Bugfixes

* Change folder structure and file name of backup files that avoid using `:` character, which is prohibited in some cloud storage services (Thanks [Ryan, Nicole, and Evan](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/is-not-supported-in-onedrive-amazon-drive-or-sync-com/2265))
