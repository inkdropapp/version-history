## v5.8.0
2024-04-03

[![2024-04-02_Inkdrop desktop v5.8.0_thumb2-play](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:ofdZM_W4O/index-public)](https://youtu.be/4-Db8eiJ0_o)

I'm excited to announce v5.8.0, which has got so many improvements and new features!
Thank you for giving me feedback during the beta testing :D

## Inter-note workflow improvements

v5.8.0 works much more efficiently in connecting your notes.

### üÜï Backlinks

If you connect your notes with internal links, you may want this feature.
You've got a metadata panel at the top of the preview pane, which displays the note information including backlinks:

[![v5-8-0_backlinks](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:B6Fpsr-8l/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:B6Fpsr-8l/index-public)

Backlinks are the notes linked to the current note.
If another note has a link to the current note, it appears in the backlinks section.
With backlinks, you can quickly jump around related notes.

### Tip: Wiki-style link creations

If you are used to writing Wiki, do you know Inkdrop supports creating placeholder links? It is simple. Just write a link without an URI!

```
- [Link title]()
```

Then, click it on the preview pane and it will create a new note with the title. As of v5.8.0, it automatically updates link titles in the note when you change the note title.

### üÜï Create a new note from the selection

When debugging a bug, you sometimes find another issue to solve as your investigation goes deeper. You already took some notes on the new issue. Inkdrop doesn't block your concentration by allowing you to create a new note from the selection.

First, select the text and right-click it on the editor:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_01](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eQzNYZaJV/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eQzNYZaJV/index-public)

A dialog shows up, then input a note title:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:iREk41NjW/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:iREk41NjW/index-public)

Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and you get a new note with the selected text.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_03](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:m-WMQ5F9a/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:m-WMQ5F9a/index-public)As you can see, you already have a backlink from the source note. You can click it to go back.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_create-new-note-from-selection_04](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:qS5q_-EaZ/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:qS5q_-EaZ/index-public)

The selected text is replaced with a link to the new note.

- New command:
  - `core:new-note-from-selection`

### üôå Remember the scroll positions

When writing a note while referring to other notes, it was frustrating to always get the cursor and scroll positions to be reset when going back to the note. In order to help you work with multiple notes efficiently, v5.8.0 now remembers the cursor and scroll positions in the navigation history.

In the above example, when clicking a backlink, the cursor position is already where the new link is created.

## Navigation improvements

### ü´° Preserve the note list order when clicking a tag on the note list item

The tag labels on the note list allow you to click to filter by a tag, which is handy to quickly narrow down to a specific topic on the list. By design, it was using the full-text search feature internally, which always changed the sort order to 'Best match'. It looked strange as you just intended to filter the current notes, but not to search with keywords, so the list sort order should be preserved. As of v5.8.0, it now properly preserves the sort order when filtering by a tag.

For example, some notes are tagged with 'v5.8.0'. Currently, the note list displays all the notes in a workspace of the notebook 'Inkdrop', ordered by last modification dates in descending order. You want to filter notes by the tag by clicking it on the note list item.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_preserve-note-list-sort-order_01](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eI86r2uX4/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:eI86r2uX4/index-public)

Then, the note list displays only notes with the tag 'v5.8.0'. Before, it changed the order to 'Best Match'. As of v5.8.0, it preserves the sort order, which is the last modification date in the descending order in this example.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_preserve-note-list-sort-order_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:zFSW1sX2o/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:zFSW1sX2o/index-public)

You can of course change the order from the dropdown menu on the note list header bar anytime.

### 'Go to Workspace' context menu

When you are checking notes in the 'All Notes' on the sidebar, you may feel like quickly jumping into a workspace view of the viewing note. You could open a notebook but it now also lets you go to the workspace view from the context menu of the notebook dropdown menu on the editor:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_go-to-workspace](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:PzVbjS52Z/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:PzVbjS52Z/index-public)

But what about nested notebooks? Let's say, you see a note in the child notebook, but you want to go to the workspace of the parent notebook. No worries. After selecting the 'Go to Workspace' context menu, the focus moves to the sidebar. Then, you can hit <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to go up to the parent workspace.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_go-to-workspace_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:9ljmf5sQR/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:9ljmf5sQR/index-public)

It is helpful to quickly switch between projects.

- New commands:
  - `editor:go-to-workspace-of-editing-note`
  - `core:sidebar-workspace-go-up`

## Editor improvements

### üîî Markdown Alerts syntax support

Recently, GitHub officially supports [Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). It is a simple extension of Markdown, which allows you to insert 'alerts' a.k.a. admonitions or callouts. For example:

```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is currently a work in progress, expect things to be broken!
```

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_gfm-alerts_01](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:c6cvtAUIq/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:c6cvtAUIq/index-public)

Inkdrop now supports these alerts, too!

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_gfm-alerts_02](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:wElcnzkli/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:wElcnzkli/index-public)

You don't have to remember the syntax. The editor toolbar has got a button for alerts here.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_gfm-alerts_03](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:7wg_OIJCm/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:7wg_OIJCm/index-public)

- New commands:
  - `core:insert-alert-note`
  - `core:insert-alert-tip`
  - `core:insert-alert-important`
  - `core:insert-alert-warning`
  - `core:insert-alert-caution`

### üîó Auto link title

Links are crucial for tech note-taking since you often need to refer to external information from your notes.

I've been using John's [paste-url](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/paste-url) plugin to paste URLs as a Markdown link. In this release, I'm happy that it is now officially supported!

For example, you are referring to a bug report on the GitHub repository and you'd like to mention it in your note. You can copy the URL from the browser and paste it in the editor, then a dialog shows up:

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_auto-link-title](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gD2U5mzPv/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gD2U5mzPv/index-public)

The app automatically fetches the page title of the given URL. You can choose a link format with up/down arrow keys. It can correctly extract the page title even if the website doesn't support server-side rendering, which is nice.

## UI design improvements

### üßê Focus outlines

I wanted to improve a small but fundamental thing - focus indicators. Since some input components like buttons and the search bar didn't have proper focus outlines, you couldn't tell where the current focus is. This improvement makes you a bit more comfortable to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move focus around.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_focus-outlines](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:ezfusyqt8/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:ezfusyqt8/index-public)

### üîñ Better tag appearances for the dark UI theme

The tag colors were too vibrant when you were on the dark UI theme. As a big fan of using tags, I wanted to make them look more unified for it.

[![v5.8.0-beta.1_tag-redesign-for-dark](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gxKqYycRI/index-public)](https://uploads.inkdrop.app/attachments/user-d975606d93c067c5ef8d6adfb5db83b5/file:gxKqYycRI/index-public)

### New option: Readable line lengths

This option limits the maximum width of the editor and preview panes to prevent excessively long lines of text. Enabled by default.

## v5.6.0
2023-10-23

## üí® Faster launch speed

Managed to make it 500-700ms faster üöÄ

Here is a demo:

![file_Gs-9UL_8u|433x500](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0c3f975cfc231e951ba923fc4d86c959cd116295.gif)

**‚úçÔ∏è STORY**: [How I made Inkdrop 500ms faster to launchüöÄ](https://www.devas.life/how-i-made-inkdrop-500ms-faster-to-launch/)

### Loading plugins lazily

Along with v5.6.0, some plugins have been updated with performance improvements as well. [mermaid](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/mermaid) and [math](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/math) load their modules only when you open a note that uses one of them. It would keep the launch speed fast even if you installed plugins that require massive modules like them.

## üé® Markdown renderer engine update

v5.6.0 has upgraded Remark and Rehype packages to the latest versions. It isn't only an internal improvement but also gives you more possibilities to get useful features. It now has `mdast` and `hast` data in [the preview state](https://developers.inkdrop.app/states/preview), which allows to add syntax-aware features like outline views more easily without relying on regular expressions.

**‚úçÔ∏è STORY**: [Refactoring the extensible Markdown renderer üõ†Ô∏è](https://www.devas.life/refactoring-the-extensible-markdown-renderer/)

On the other hand, it may cause some plugins not working due to the breaking changes. For plugin developers, I'll post another topic to help you update your plugins.

## üåà Built-in paste-as-markdown support

Plugins are useful but it'd be a burden to explore and decide which plugins to install for light users. I wanted to make the app just work out of the box. As a starter, `paste-as-markdown` is now bundled into the app by default. It allows you to paste HTML as Markdown from the clipboard. It'd be useful for copy-and-pasting formatted texts from browsers.

I'm planning to bundle **Mermaid**, **GitHub Emoji**, and **Math** plugins as well.

## üòµ Acrylic window style is not working on Windows

* https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/lag-when-resizing-the-window-with-acrylic-background/4011

On Electron@25.1.1, the module that the app used to support the acrylic window style no longer works, unfortunately. The good news is that Electron itself officially supports the acrylic style for Windows:

* [feat: support Mica/Acrylic on Windows by codebytere ¬∑ Pull Request #38163 ¬∑ electron/electron ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38163)

The bad news is that it is not stable and working as expected ‚Äì It doesn't work with frameless windows, besides, it becomes unresizable and loses shadows. So, unfortunately, the acrylic window style is not supported on Windows in this release.

## ‚ú® Nested workspace views
In previous versions, pressing the "Detail" button on the notebook would take you to the workspace view, but you couldn't press the "Detail" button again once you were in that view.
In this update, the "Detail" button is now functional within the workspace view as well!

![nested workspace view](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/7/70deb1d54021785330b8ff881f949ac253e9c37a.jpeg)

The sidebar now displays the path of the current and parent notebooks:

![nested workspace view 2](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b4d01ce272032530449d11aa068cd52c488f928b.jpeg)

## Quick notebook picker for moving notes

You can more quickly choose a notebook :D

![notebook picker improved](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/original/2X/c/cb7323cd2469b5edaa8ce1e859a9f699ee6be4f2.jpeg)


## ‚ú® New API documentation (WIP)

![Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 15.01.06|690x439](https://forum.inkdrop.app/uploads/default/optimized/2X/1/17f34dadcd6918de386222e143eeb1fea9adea5c_2_1380x878.jpeg)


I've been working on redesigning the documentation and the new API documentation is now available as WIP.

https://developers.inkdrop.app/

The design is heavily inspired by Stripe, built on top of Tailwind UI. It supports full-text search now. There are still many missing pages and broken links though, your help to improve the doc would be greatly appreciated. It will be more comprehensive and easy to understand and I hope you like it :D

I'll be working on creating a new user manual as well!

## Design updates for Windows and Linux!

The default white title bar on Windows messes up the app clean design, especially with dark themes.
In this release, you've got the new custom title bar with a frameless window. Please take a look at this:

![Custom title bar on Windows](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.4.0-default-dark.png?raw=true)

By getting rid of the white strip bar, we can now have the acrylic translucent background on Windows, which looks stunning:

![Vibrant dark UI demo](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.4.0-vibrant-dark.png?raw=true)

Try installing [vibrant-dark-ui theme](https://my.inkdrop.app/plugins/vibrant-dark-ui).

## v5.3.0
2021-05-03

You've got big updates that would significantly improve your workflow üí™

### Local REST API endpoint
It allows other programs to access your data in your computer via a simple HTTP API. Why is it awesome? See below..

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/accessing-the-local-database/#accessing-via-http-advanced)

### Alfred integration for searching notes quickly
![Alfref integration](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-integrating-with-alfred_screenshot.png?raw=true)

With the local REST API endpoint enabled, it gives a lot of possibilities to integrate Inkdrop with the existing productivity tools like Alfred!
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is the powerful alternative to Spotlight on macOS. By integrating Inkdrop and Alfred, you can instantly search your notes from Alfred.

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/integrating-with-alfred)

### Browser integrations for clipping web pages in Markdown
![Web clipper](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-web-clipper.png?raw=true)

Another benefit of having the local REST endpoint is the web clipper.
It lets you save any web page off the internet to your Inkdrop database in Markdown so you can read or edit it later, while synchronizing it securely via the end-to-end encryption.
The browser extensions are available for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox!

* [See the documentation for more detail](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/clipping-web-pages-from-browser)

### Better note conflict resolution
![Conflicted note](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0-conflict-resolver.png?raw=true)

Inkdrop sometimes automatically resolves note conflicts but it could cause unwanted results in some cases.
In this update, it provides a dedicated UI for resolving the note conflicts.
You can view conflicted revisions in a separate window respectively to manually resolve the conflicts, which would prevent losing your edits.
It will be also supported in the mobile version.

### Other New features
* Show editing note title in title bar
  ![Title bar](https://github.com/inkdropapp/version-history/blob/master/images/v5.3.0_title.png?raw=true)
