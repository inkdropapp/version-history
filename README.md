## v5.1.1
2020-09-24

g'day. Automn is coming! üçÅ

### Faster restoration of navigation state
Quicker to resume your work!

### Add 'Insert image' toolbar button
I don't remember why I didn't add it before, haha.

### Good news for vimmers: 'Open Link' context menu for URL tokens in the editor
When you use it with vim plugin, double-clicking to open a link does not work as the event is handled by the plugin.
Allowing to open a link from the context menu would solve such issue.
Also we got 'Copy Link Address' menu as well.

### Bugfixes

## v5.1.0
2020-09-21

### It remembers your work state! ü§Ø
Now it supports restoring the last navigation state on launching.
It means that Inkdrop remembers which note you were editing, and sidebar and note list state, including search keywords.
So, you can quickly resume your work even if you fell asleep in the middle of work :)

### Better note exportability
When you wrote up a note, it should be able to be exported quickly. This update improves the note exportability so that you can work with other apps faster.

* Support "Copy as HTML" and "Copy as Simple HTML" context menu to note list (Thanks [Joey](https://forum.inkdrop.app/t/can-you-add-copy-as-html-function/2083))

* Support exporting a notebook as Markdown or HTML from sidebar context menu
